2012-01-30
New release to support the next version of Thunderbird (10) which is released 
31/01/2012. This was a LTS release and Mozilla changed the way the updates 
were handled so we don't have to update the extension everytime there is a new
TB release.

Another minor update to fix a problem in the Portuguese language translation.

* Fixed charset error in the locale/pt-BR/vtiger.properties file that crept
  into 0.5. The file was in ISO-8859-15. It should have been in UTF-8


0.501
2010-12-01

A very minor update to fix a typo in the Italian language translation.

* Fixed syntax error in the locale/it-IT/vtiger.dtd file that crept into 0.5


0.5
2010-11-26

This release introduces several new features along with a fairly extensive
re-work of the way the dialogue forms are populated and general re-factoring
of some of the underlying code; hopefully this particular work will not
introduce any new errors. It should help with general maintenance and new
feature additions going forward.

0.5 introduces a new feature to create a new Lead or Contact from within 
Thunderbird. A new dialogue enables the user to provide basic details and will
also, if selected, use information from the current message to auto-populate
the form. The dialogue also enables a new Contact to be assigned to an existing
Account through a search facility. 

There is also a minor new feature whereby you can right click on any email
address in the message header and use that to create a new Lead or contact too.

0.5 also incorporates a little "intelligence" in how the extension chooses
the email address to populate the search field in the "Add message to vtiger"
dialogue box. If the email's author has an account in Thunderbird we now choose
the first email address in the To: or CC: fields instead. Unfortunately this
seems not to be 100% reliable in testing. I would welcome any feedback to 
identify the cause. The detection code is the isTBAccount() function in 
vtiger_lib.js. If it doesn't work, click on another message then go back and
try again. It seems to work 2nd time around most times for me.

0.5 also includes the ability to have the vtiger web interface open in a
Thunderbird tab. Potentially this could be very useful for tighter integration
in the future. Please share your feedback on this enhancement. You will notice 
a little vtiger button on the far right of the tab bar. Click this to open your
vtiger interface inside Thunderbird. All URLs which are _not_ local to your 
vtiger should be opened in your default web browser. This is not perfect and 
I expect some features of the vtiger UI to not work. It's more of a "proof of
concept" for some future ideas but I have found it somewhat useful even so.

Please report your feedback and comments to the project's home on github:

0.4.3
2010-10-28

Added support for bi-directional transfer of the "description" field of the
Leads and Contacts modules and the "Notes" field of the Thunderbird address
book.

0.4.2
2010-12-10
Added support for automatic updates to this extension.
The extension .xpi files must now be signed using the mozilla tool McCoy.
Future extension upgrades will be made available via this forge project's
website location: http://vttb3.forge.vtiger.com/updates/
No other changes were made to this version.

* Updated manifest.json to enable automatic updates of this extension.


0.4.1
2010-09-28
Minor update to the extension to work with the newly released vtiger 5.2.0.
Required a bump to the apiVersion parameter and I tweaked the api test to allow
the extension to continue to work with vtiger 5.1.0 as well.

* Bumped API version to 0.22 to work with vtiger 5.2.0.
* Modified API version test to support both vtiger 5.1.0 & 5.2.0


0.4
2010-09-26
Several new features and enhancements in this release. Change from using
javascript alertMessage() popups for all extension messages (all required user
acknowledgement) to using system based notifications for informative messages.
Also added a new feature to automatically "tag" an email when it is 
successfully added to vtiger. The Tag name and colour is user-configurable. 
This also required adding a preferences dialogue to allow the auto-tagging
feature to be enabled or disabled by the user. Added a context (right-click)
menu to the main Address Book list view pane to facilitate adding entries to 
Leads or Contacts. In 0.4-testing the session management changes didn't work,
properly; these have now been rectified by reverting to the earlier method
introduced in version 0.3.

* Feature request #256: Add feature to use system notifications for informative
  messages
* Feature request #279: Add automatic tagging of emails - Thanks Andrew Wilson
* Add user-configurable preferences dialogue to enable or disable tagging
  feature
* Feature request #239: Add context menu to Address Book for adding to Contacts
  or Leads
* Merge vtiger team code improvements for:
  * Using the "hidden iframe" technique for HTML email content retrieval
* Update manifest.json to support TB 3.2+ versions


0.4-testing
2010-08-16
Initial test release. Messages that are positive in tone, and really just
informative now use the Operating System's built-in notification system (Growl
for OSX and libnotify for Linux) or a xul based alert. This is an alternative 
to the standard Javascript alert messages which required user acknowledgement 
and - in my opinion - were unnecessary and intrusive. Also merged in the recent
changes made by the vtiger team mainly regarding the session management.

* Implement showAlertNotification() for informative messages.
* Merge vtiger team changes to session management and improved (correct) 
  handling of email message content.


0.3.1
2010-07-21
Minor extension update to support the new TB 3.1.1 release.

* Updated manifest.json to support TB 3.1.* versions. 


0.3
2010-06-17
Provide a new login & session control system. This extension requires that php
is built with JSON support. In most cases this will be the default, but if you
experience problems similar to bug #264 you are probably missing JSON support.
If you are using a version before 0.2.2, the first time you start this version,
you will see the first run check. Please accept the dialogue and save your 
settings as normal. After that you will be logged in silently when starting 
Thunderbird. The Birthday and Website fields in the Thunderbird Address Book 
are now exported to vtiger Contacts and Leads respectively. This version has
also been successfully tested against the Verification Build 2 of the 
forthcoming vtiger 5.2.0 release. Please test further and report any issues.
 
* Fix bug #236 with the login & session management improvements.
* Implement Feature Request #230 with the improved login and session manager. 
* Implement Feature Requests #269 & #270 by exporting the Birthday and Website
  fields from the Thunderbird Address Book -  Thanks Juan Villaverde. 
* Implemented changes to support working against the updated webservices 
  interface of vtiger 5.2.0VB2. 


0.2.3-testing
2010-05-28
Initial test release fix the session login/timeout problems. There should now
be no need to ever visit the vtiger configuration screen once the extension 
has been properly configured on first run. The extension should login 
automatically on startup and keep the session live. It does this by storing 
the time-since-epoch when it first logs in and then checking this as necessary.
The timer is incremented on successful transactions and reset (re-login) after
25 minutes of inactivity or more.

* Added an automated login and session keep-alive system. 


0.2.2
2010-05-20
This release includes a new Brazilian Portuguese translation, and an automatic
login on start-up and "first run" check.  This new feature is the beginning of
some work to enable the extension to maintain a connection to the vtiger CRM 
irrespective of the inactivity time of a user. Further work is still necessary
to complete this however. This release also fixes a bug when adding an email 
the search query would not return more than 100 results.

* Fixed bug #273. When adding an email to a lead or contact, a broad search
  query would only ever return a maximum of 100 results - Thanks Mark Geertsema
* Add feature to login automatically on start up. 
* Brazilian Portuguese translation - Thanks Valmir Carlos Trindade


0.2.1
2010-05-13
Several bugs in the 0.2.0 version were discovered soon after release. This
version corrects those and includes the completed Spanish (es-ES) translations.

Changes:
* Fixed bug #268 that prevented several fields being added when using the 
  "Add as Contact" feature of the Thunderbird Address Book. - Thanks Juan 
  Villaverde
* Fixed some minor bugs in the translation code work that might have caused
  silent failures when adding an email.
* Included the completed translation strings for es-ES (Spanish)


0.2.0
2010-05-13
Completes the majority of the i18n work on the extension. Also includes a bug
fix which prevented adding leads from addressbook if they had no company name.

* Major i18n work and updates - some strings still require translation.
* Fixed bug #261 - Thanks Istvan Holbok
* Updated manifest.json to support all versions of Thunderbird 3 up to and 
  including 3.1.


0.1.4-a
2010-04-12
Minor update release includes a bug fix to the Hungarian localisation.
* Correct missing entity declarations. 


0.1.4
2010-04-05
Release includes all previous enhancements and fixes including support for
saving HTML emails in full. It also fixes a couple of bugs and adds additional
translations for Spanish and Hungarian.

* Add Spanish i18n translation - thanks Joe Bordes 
* Add Hungarian translation - thanks Istvan Holbok
* Fix for bug 247 which severely limited the extension's search functionality
  - thanks Joe Bordes.
* Fix for bug 255 which prevented the extension from saving emails to Contacts
  that did not have an Account in vtiger - thanks Joe Bordes.


0.1.3
2010-03-30
Initial test code to support copying HTML emails to vtiger. Works for text
messages and html messages with externally linked images. Inline images are
not handled (and probably won't be).

* Added initial support for passing HTML emails to vtiger. 
* Added initial support for a column in the main tree view to flag messages
  as saved to vtiger (not functional yet). 


0.1.2
2010-03-22
Release includes Italian Language translation and an initial fix for the
missing Line Breaks in saved emails. This fix does not support HTML emails
but it should add XHTML Line Breaks to all messages maintaining paragraph
spacing etc.

* First international translation (Italian) - Thanks Carlo Beschi.
* Fix the lack of line breaks which occur when an email is saved to vtiger.


0.1.1a
2010-03-12
Minor release to include support for the recently released Thunderbird 
3.1beta. All new development will be for this platform (Gecko 1.9.2).

* Updated manifest.json to include support up to and including versions 3.1b2
  of Thunderbird.


0.1a
2010-02-16
First release of the vtiger extension for Thunderbird 3.0. Many of the known
limitations in the existing vtiger extension for Thunderbird 2 still remain to
be addressed. Please test and report any problems. Although this works for me,
it should be considered ALPHA software at this stage. 

* Migrated the existing Thunderbird 2 extension to work with the recently
  released Thunderbird 3 series; tested up to TB3.0.3. 
* Fixed a bug whereby you could not import more than 100 contacts from vtiger.
* Introduced initial support for localisation.
